WOOF!

# dogbin has been updated!

* You can now Link to a specific line in your paste by adding #L<linenumber> to the end of the URL,
  or by simply clicking on the line you want to link to and copying that URL
* Controls and line numbers are not selectable anymore, so Ctrl + A should work flawlessly
* The title attribute on the homepage has been fixed and it should now show 'dogbin' and not 'hastebin'
* The [about page](/about.md) has finally been updated
* Add built-in changelog feature because this really was needed *OwO*
